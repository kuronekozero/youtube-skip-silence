**YouTube Skip Silence** is a browser extension that skips silent parts of YouTube videos. It works by analyzing the timestamps in a video's **auto-generated captions** to find periods with no speech.

The extension is available for **Google Chrome** (and other Chromium browsers) and **Mozilla Firefox**.

## ✨ Features

The extension is designed to remove dead air with simple configuration options:

* **Silence Skipping:** The main feature is automatically jumping over segments where no speech is detected.
* **Custom Skip Settings:** You can adjust how the skipping works for a smoother experience:
    * **Post-Speech Delay:** Adds a short delay after someone stops speaking before a skip is initiated.
    * **Pre-Speech Offset:** Configures the skip to land a moment *before* the next speech starts, preventing an abrupt beginning.
* **General Controls:** The popup menu provides settings to:
    * Enable or disable the skipping feature.
    * Set the **minimum duration of silence** that should be skipped.
    * Control if skipping continues after you manually seek (jump) to a new point in the video.

## 📂 Project Structure

This section outlines the main files for those who want to modify the code:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`manifest.json`** | The core configuration file. It defines permissions, registers scripts, and the user interface. |
| **`background.js`** | A background script that intercepts network requests to capture YouTube's caption data URLs (`timedtext`). |
| **`content.js`** | This script is injected into the video page. It gets the caption data, finds silent gaps, and controls the video player to perform skips. |
| **`popup.html`** | The HTML file that defines the structure of the settings panel. |
| **`popup.js`** | The JavaScript logic for the settings panel, including saving user settings. |
| **`shared-constants.js`** | Contains variables and constants shared across different scripts. |
| **`toast.css`** | The stylesheet for on-screen notifications. |

## 🚀 Future Updates

A future update is planned to include **usage statistics**. This will track the total time saved by skipping silent segments across all videos.

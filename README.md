**YouTube Skip Silence** is a browser extension that skips silent parts of YouTube videos. It works by analyzing the timestamps in a video's **auto-generated captions** to find periods with no speech.

The extension is available for **Mozilla Firefox** and **Google Chrome** (and other Chromium browsers).

## ‚ú® Features

The extension is designed to remove dead air with simple configuration options:

* **Silence Skipping:** The main feature is automatically jumping over segments where no speech is detected.
* **Custom Skip Settings:** You can adjust how the skipping works for a smoother experience:
    * **Post-Speech Delay:** Adds a short delay after someone stops speaking before a skip is initiated.
    * **Pre-Speech Offset:** Configures the skip to land a moment *before* the next speech starts, preventing an abrupt beginning.
* **General Controls:** The popup menu provides settings to:
    * Enable or disable the skipping feature.
    * Set the **minimum duration of silence** that should be skipped.
    * Control if skipping continues after you manually seek (jump) to a new point in the video.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This section outlines the main files for those who want to modify the code:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`manifest.json`** | The core configuration file. It defines permissions, registers scripts, and the user interface. |
